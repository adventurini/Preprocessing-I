<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br>
<p>With years of experience in real estate investing and sales,
  coupled with analytical skills from playing poker on a world class,
  professional level, I have quite a different vantage point and skillsets
  than the ordinary.

    <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
    <h5>Real Estate Professional</h5>
    <h6>Licensed Agent</h6>
    <p>Spent a couple of years working as a licensed real estate agent in Michigan. Had the chance to work on some amazing projects, including the sale
      of 6432 Woodward Avenue (Detroit Hardware) and further helped find a redevelopment tenant, which is 
      still an ongoing development.
    </p> 
    <h6>Real Estate Investing</h6>
    <p>Managed flips, two new builds, and 20+ rentals for several years for investment group from Detroit area.
      Personally flipped 3 houses which were very rewarding projects. I was twice featured in <a href="https://detroit.curbed.com/2018/1/19/16910668/east-english-village-home-rustic-modern-for-sale" >CURBED!</a> 
       </p>
       <br> 
    <h5>Professional Poker</h5>
    <p>Poker is probably the 'coolest' thing I have done. In my early twenties, I had the opportunity
      to travel around the world and play poker in over 15 countries. I had some decent successes and some
      really incredible experiences.
